*Machine Learning for Trading*

## Project Overview
*GUC 2018 Bachelor Thesis Project*

Stock market prediction is an interesting realm to test the capabilities of machine learning
on. The nature of the stock market is volatile, complicated, and very sensitive to external 
information, which makes it difficult to predict. Different machine learning models are 
developed to forecast future stock prices. Technical indicators are computed using historical 
stock prices to provide the machine learning model with a daily time series of a stock prices 
indications to learn and develop its prediction engine based on. The models used are: Linear 
Regressor, kNN Regressor, FFNN, and RNN LSTM. The prediction models are compared 
and evaluated using different metrics. Several case studies are performed to evaluate the 
performance of the prediction model. From the case studies, few results are obtained: 

1. Technical indicators can be used to teach a machine learning model about the nature of 
a certain stock in the stock market, the model can then be used to predict future prices. 
2. The model is capable of predicting the price and the fluctuations in price caused by the 
stock market movement. 
3. The model naturally lags on picking up on external events that impact the stock price suddenly.
4. The LSTM RNN outperformed all the other models.

The research mainly aims to exploit the capabilities of machine learning in the field of stock trading.
It also aims to propose backed-up hypothesis and analysis on the capabilities of machine learning in
the domain of stock price prediction.

The research questions for the bachelor thesis are:

* *Can machine learning be used to predict future stock prices?*

Is it possible to design a machine learning model that is trained  on historical prices of a 
certain stock, and to be able to query the model for future prices? How reliable will the model
be? What are the model's constraints, guarantees, and weaknesses?
* *How does the performance of different machine learning algorithms vary?*

Which machine learning algorithm does the best job, and how do the different algorithms compare
with each other? A grading criteria should be designed to compare and assess the algorithms.

## Algorithms Evaluation
*Development Phase*

* [Original](https://github.com/ahmedhamdi96/ML4T/blob/master/machine_learning/development/original_evaluation.md)
* [New](https://github.com/ahmedhamdi96/ML4T/blob/master/machine_learning/development/new_evaluation.md)

## Testing
*Testing Phase*

    * Considering that the LSTM model is regarded as the flagship machine learning model in this project, 
    it is the one used in this testing section.

    * The model is trained on the period starting from a company's first public trading day till the day 
    before the required testing period.

### During Times of Change
*Predicting Stock prices for a portfolio of 4 companies during different interesting time periods*

* **[Facebook](https://github.com/ahmedhamdi96/ML4T/blob/master/machine_learning/development/testing/results/facebook.md)**

  *Facebook started trading publicly on 18/05/2012.*

  * Facebookâ€“Cambridge Analytica data scandal, [January/2018 - March/2018]

    Amid the scandal and Mark Zuckerburg's public hearing, Facebook's stock price fell.

* **[Apple](https://github.com/ahmedhamdi96/ML4T/blob/master/machine_learning/development/testing/results/apple.md)**

  *Apple started trading publicly on 12/12/1980.*

  * Apple's first free fall, [September/2012 - June/2013]

    Apple faced multiple hardships during this period; earnings were no longer growing, 
    low-priced phones were capturing most of the smartphone market share over the iPhone,
    and the company entered the "post-Steve Jobs" era where the company's next generation 
    of leaders and products were in question.


* **[Tesla](https://github.com/ahmedhamdi96/ML4T/blob/master/machine_learning/development/testing/results/tesla.md)**

  *Tesla started trading publicly on 29/06/2010.*

  Tesla's stock is volatile as a result of many factors including: failing to meet plans 
  and expensive acquisitions and investments.

  * Analysts downgrades, [September/2013 - November/2013]

    Lowered volume expectations for Model X and Model 3, a lower valuation for Tesla Energy, 
    and accelerating competition in the mobility business were some of the reasons analysts
    lowered Tesla's stock price target.

* **[Amazon](https://github.com/ahmedhamdi96/ML4T/blob/master/machine_learning/development/testing/results/amazon.md)**

  *Amazon started trading publicly on 15/05/1997.*

  Overall Amazon's stock throughout its run since 1997 has been healthy, with projections mostly 
  heading upwards and with little volatility.

  * Exceeding Q3 expectations, [September/2017 - February/2018]

    Amazon's Q3 reports showed an increase in profits, an acceleration in revenue growth, an increase 
    in AWS' operating income, and the success of Alexa-enabled devices.

### Window and Time Steps Test
A test to determine the optimal window and time steps. See results [here](https://github.com/ahmedhamdi96/ML4T/blob/master/machine_learning/development/testing/results/window_and_ts.md).

### Evaluation Metrics
New metrics to evaluate the performance of the model over different future gaps. See results [here](https://github.com/ahmedhamdi96/ML4T/blob/master/machine_learning/development/testing/results/eval.md).

## Analysis
*Analysing the tests using a novel metric*

To analyse the forecast and evaluate how fast does the model predict the closest price to the actual, a lag metric is created.
The **_Prediction-Actual Lag (PAL)_** metric works as follows: 
The future gap chosen when making the forecast indicates how far into the future should a prediction be, for example if the future gap is set to 1, the forecast is a next-trading-day forecast. The actual prices are traversed and compared with the predictions, each actual price datapoint is compared against a number of the prediction data points, that number is the future gap, so if the future gap is set to 5, then each actual datapoint is compared to the corresponding prediction datapoint and the 4 next to it. See **_PAL_** in action [here](https://github.com/ahmedhamdi96/ML4T/blob/master/machine_learning/development/testing/results/analysis.md).
